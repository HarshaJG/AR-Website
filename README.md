# Augmentour

## Overview

**Augmentour** is an Augmented Reality (AR) web app designed to help tourists explore new places. By marking Points of Interest (POIs) with 3D AR markers and providing real-time AR navigation, Augmentour offers an engaging and informative way to experience a city or location. The app uses AR.js and A-Frame for AR functionalities and integrates OpenStreetMap and the Mapbox API for navigation and mapping.

## Features

- **3D AR Markers for POIs:** Interactive 3D markers highlight points of interest. Users can click on these markers to summon a virtual tour guide for more information.
- **Real-Time AR Navigation:** 3D arrow markers provide real-time navigation, guiding users to their desired destinations.
- **Virtual Tour Guide:** Detailed information about each POI is available through an engaging virtual tour guide.
- **Map Integration:** Utilizes OpenStreetMap and Mapbox API for accurate mapping and navigation.

## Technologies Used

- **AR.js:** A library for creating AR experiences on the web.
- **A-Frame:** A framework for building virtual reality (VR) experiences.
- **OpenStreetMap:** A collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world.
- **Mapbox API:** Provides mapping and navigation services.
- **Vercel:** Platform for deploying and hosting the web application.
